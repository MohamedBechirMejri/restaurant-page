# restaurant-page

[Demo](https://mohamedbechirmejri.github.io/restaurant-page/)

restaurant page project. part of TheOdinProject Curriculum.

What I've learned

- How to install and configure webpack
- how to use multiple javascript files together
- how to use javascript to generate pages

didn't focus much on the content and style of the page since the goal of this project is to get used to webpack.
